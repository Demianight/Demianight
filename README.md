## About me
I showed interest to programming in young age. <br />
I started by drawing beautiful fractals, such as Dragon or Mandelbrot fractals. <br />
Then I accidentally got Yandex.Practikum course on backend development and got really exited. <br /> 
Now I am on my own, learning new stuff. For example frontend, ML and gamedev. <br />
