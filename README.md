## About me
I am 17 years old. I showed interest to programming in young age. 
I started by drawing beautiful fractals, such as Dragon or Mandelbrot fractals.
Then I accidentally got Yandex.Practikum course about backend development and got really exited. 
Now I am on my own, learning new stuff. For example frontend, ML and even gamedev.
